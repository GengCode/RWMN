We propose a novel memory network model named Read-Write Memory Network (RWMN) to perform question and answering tasks for large-scale, multimodal movie story understanding. The key focus of our RWMN model is to design the read network and the write network that consist of multiple convolutional layers, which enable memory read and write operations to have high capacity and flexibility. For evaluation, we apply our model to all the six tasks of the [MovieQA benchmark](http://movieqa.cs.toronto.edu/home/), and achieve the best accuracies on several tasks, especially on the visual QA task.

## Code will be released soon!
